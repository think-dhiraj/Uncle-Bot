Now, let me help you with that..."

Let me help you schedule that meeting..."
```

User: "I'm so busy with work today"
AI: "Why did the AI break up with the computer? It needed more space! 💻
I understand you're swamped! Let me help you tackle this workload..."
```

### 🚀 How to Test Right Now

#### Option 1: Web Application (Recommended)
1. **Open your browser** and go to: `http://localhost:3000`

4. **Try these test messages**:
   - "Can you help me with my email?"
   - "I need to schedule a meeting"
   - "I'm so busy with work today"
   - "What's the weather like?"

#### Option 2: API Testing
1. **Test the API directly**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/chat/send \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "Can you help me with my email?"}'
   ```

#### Option 3: Run Demo Scripts
