## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY FIRST STEPS

**1. Review the Task List:** Before doing ANYTHING else, read `TODO.md`. This file is the single source of truth for all completed, pending, and in-progress tasks.

**2. Review Project Context:** After checking the `TODO.md`, read `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`. This file contains the detailed architecture, configuration, and implementation status.

**DO NOT** start working on a task before checking its status in `TODO.md`.

## âœ… Your Workflow

### 1. **Consult `TODO.md`** (ALWAYS FIRST)
This file tracks our progress. Check it to see what needs to be done next.

### 2. **Read `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for Details**
This file provides the "how" and "why" behind the tasks.

### 3. **Work on Pending Tasks**
Select a pending task from `TODO.md` and begin work.

### 4. **Update `TODO.md`** (MANDATORY)
After you make any progressâ€”completing a step, adding a new feature, or fixing a bugâ€”you **MUST** update `TODO.md` immediately. Change `[ ]` to `[x]` for completed tasks.
