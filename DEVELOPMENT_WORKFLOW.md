## 🌳 Branch Strategy

### **Main Branches**
- **`main`** - Production-ready code, stable releases
- **`develop`** - Integration branch for features, staging environment

### **Development Branches**
- **`frontend-dev`** - Frontend developer's working branch
- **`backend-dev`** - Backend developer's working branch  
- **`ai-dev`** - AI developer's working branch

### **Feature Branches** (Created from `develop`)
- **`feature/frontend-*`** - Frontend features (e.g., `feature/frontend-auth`, `feature/frontend-chat`)
- **`feature/backend-*`** - Backend features (e.g., `feature/backend-webhooks`, `feature/backend-ai`)
- **`feature/ai-*`** - AI features (e.g., `feature/ai-memory`, `feature/ai-personality`)

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### **1. Daily Development Process**

#### **For Each Developer:**
```bash
# Start your day
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout your-dev-branch
git merge develop  # Get latest changes

# Work on your tasks...
# Make commits with clear messages

# End of day - push your work
git push origin your-dev-branch
```

#### **For Lead Developer (AI Assistant):**
```bash
# Review and merge developer branches
git checkout develop
git merge frontend-dev
git merge backend-dev  
git merge ai-dev

# Test integration
pnpm dev
pnpm test

# Push to develop
git push origin develop
```

### **2. Feature Development Process**

#### **Creating a New Feature:**
```bash
# From develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Work on feature...
# Make commits

# When ready for review
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
# Create Pull Request to develop
```

#### **Code Review Process:**
1. **Developer** creates Pull Request to `develop`
2. **Lead Developer (AI Assistant)** reviews code
3. **Lead Developer** approves and merges
4. **Lead Developer** tests integration
5. **Lead Developer** pushes to `develop`

### **3. Release Process**

#### **Staging Release (develop → main):**
```bash
# Lead Developer
git checkout main
git merge develop
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin main --tags
```
